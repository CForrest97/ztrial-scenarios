    <shortdesc>Zowe offers modern interfaces that enables you to interact with <tm trademark="z/OS" tmtype="reg">z/OS</tm> in a way that is similar to what you experience on cloud platforms today.

<p>This scenario walks you through the Zowe interfaces including the Zowe Desktop and Zowe CLI
through several simple tasks to help you get familiar with Zowe.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you are new to Zowe, start with this scenario to explore the base Zowe features and
functions.</li>
<li>If you are already familiar with Zowe interfaces and capabilities, you can skip this scenario
and directly go to the <xref href="../Zowe_Extend/1_overview.dita">Extending Zowe</xref>  scenario
which guides you to extend Zowe by creating your own APIs and applications.</li>
</ul>
<p>This scenario guides you through the steps in roughly 30 minutes. By the end of the session,
youâ€™ll know how to:<ul>
<li>Log in to the Zowe Desktop</li>
<li>View and edit data sets by using the <tm trademark="MVS" tmtype="tm">MVS</tm> Explorer</li>
<li>Query jobs with filters and view the related status by using the JES Explorer</li>
<li>View jobs by using TN3270 in the Zowe Desktop</li>
<li>Edit data sets and upload to mainframe by using Zowe Command Line Interface (CLI)</li>
</ul></p>
<p>As an introductory scenario, no previous knowledge of Zowe is needed. Please wait a moment while
your development environment loads (this takes a minute or so). When it loads, get started by
logging in to the Zowe Desktop.</p>
<!--<p>If you haven't started the scenario, complete the following steps: 1. Double-click Z Trial Wizard.exe on the desktop. 1. In the Z Trial Program window, select the scenario that you want and click **Explore scenario**. 1. In the pop-up window, click **Start scenario**</p>-->
