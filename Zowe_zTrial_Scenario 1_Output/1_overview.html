through several simple tasks to help you get familiar with Zowe.</p>
<ul class="ul" id="part1_ims__ul_bqv_4ct_zgb"><li class="li">If you are new to Zowe, start with this scenario to explore the base Zowe features and
functions.</li>
<li class="li">If you are already familiar with Zowe interfaces and capabilities, you can skip this scenario
and directly go to <a class="xref" href="../Zowe_Extend/1_overview.html">the Extending Zowe scenario</a>
which guides you to extend Zowe by creating your own APIs and applications.</li>
</ul>
<div class="p">This scenario guides you through the steps in roughly 30 minutes. By the end of the session,
you’ll know how to:<ul class="ul" id="part1_ims__ul_tnv_4ct_zgb"><li class="li">Log in to the Zowe Desktop</li>
<li class="li">View and edit data sets by using the MVS Explorer</li>
<li class="li">Query jobs with filters and view the related status by using the JES Explorer</li>
<li class="li">View jobs by using TN3270 in the Zowe Desktop</li>
<li class="li">Edit data sets and upload to mainframe by using Zowe Command Line Interface (CLI)</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p class="p">As an introductory scenario, no previous knowledge of Zowe is needed. Please wait a moment while
your development environment loads (this takes a minute or so). When it loads, get started by
logging in to the Zowe Desktop.</p>
