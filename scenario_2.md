# Scenario 2: Extending Zowe

## Overview 

In this scenario, you will learn how to extend Zowe to add your own API or application. This scenario guides you through the steps in roughly 30 minutes. By the end of the session, you'll know how to:

- Extend the API by adding a REST API to the API Mediation Layer
- Extend Zowe Web UI by creating and deploying an application plug-in on Zowe Desktop
- Extend Zowe CLI by creating a Zowe CLI plug-in to access the API

No previous knowledge of Zowe or API design is needed. Please wait a moment while your development environment loads (this takes a minute or so). When it loads, get started by creating the API project.

## Step 1: Adding a REST API service to the API Mediation Layer

You will add some missing code to expose an API in API Medidation Layer and then access your API service endpoints to ensure that it works. 

<!--Requirements on the client system: -->

**Procedure**

1. Identify the APIs you want to expose.
1. Define the routing of your API.
1. Define your service and API in YAML format.
1. Add your service to the API Mediation Layer.
1. Validate that your service is running and you can access the service endpoints.
1. Add your service definition to the API Mediation Layer running as part of the Zowe runtime installation.

**Next step**



## Step 2: Creating and deploying an application on Zowe Desktop

You will complete a sample application and deploy the application on Zowe Desktop. 

In this step, you will combine some provided code snippets with the skeleton code to build a complete application that displays on the Zowe Desktop.

<!--Requirements on the client system: -->

**Procedure**

1. Define the `pluginDefinition.json` file.
1. Construct a simple Angular UI.
1. Add your app to the desktop.

## Step 3: Extending a Zowe CLI plug-in

You will extend an existing Zowe CLI plug-in by introducing the Node.js programmatic API in scenario 1, and create a command definition with a handler. 

<!--Requirements on the client system: -->

**Procedure**

1. Defining command syntax
1. Defining command handler
